Logic as a fragile inference system, dependent more on the strength of the context it resides within.
Focus on getting the contexts right:

>> "It's not logic that is powerful...logic is actually a weak method because it depends on fragile chains of inference.  And people have used logic throughout history, but mostly in inappropriate contexts. 

>> There is nothing illogical about the way the alchemists or the babylonians did things, it's that they were in a context in which their logic couldn't do much"

>> "**This notion that the context is powerful** - and if you want to be good at solving problems and acting much smarter than you are then you have to find a context that is going to do most of the thinking for you."

## History: Framing Contexts

### [J. C. R. Licklider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._C._R._Licklider#Psychoacoustics)
Initial Pentagon funder of the research community in the 1950/60s that ultimately produced things like "The Internet" (a profound accomplishment for humanity, and example of collectively distributed globally decentralized network packet routing system.)

<!-- Field of study: [Psychoacoustics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoacoustics) -->

Licklider's vision that he used to  coordinate and guide the direction of the disparate talent that formed  ARPA/DARPA research community.
